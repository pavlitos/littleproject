I have fixed the ViewEventsGui and the TasksGUI, still getting error on the ViewTasksGUI.  However I have made it that way that when someone wants to see the tasks it will print them on the console.  
Uploaded all the classes here, so you can be up to date.  
##The same way I did the ViewTasks we can do the ViewFinancialRequests and the ViewRecruitmentRequests.  
I added the ViewFinancialRequestsGUI and ViewRecruitmentRequestsGUI. Everything is working as it should except for the ViewTasksGUI.
